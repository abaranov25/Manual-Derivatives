# Manual-Derivatives
An independent project of computationally calculating derivatives for discontinuous functions (Work in progress)

Project Description:  
The idea of this project is that calculating derivatives mathematically fails when functions are discontinuous. Therefore,
it is impossible to approximate a discontinuous function with a Taylor series. This project seeks to computationally
take the nth derivative of a function given a finite set of points that lie on the graph, and then use a Taylor series to
approximate the function that best represents the input points. The output function will be used to interpolate and extrapolate
values given a data set.


Progress:  
The approximate function has been made and works well with mathematically definable functions (such as f(x) = x * cos(2x)). However,
it has yet to be seen how the function performs under real world data.
